# Exchange Adapter Pattern Implementation Notes

## Overview of Changes

We've refactored the exchange adapter implementation from a simple interface-based approach to an abstract class-based approach. This change provides better structure, reduces code duplication, and makes it easier to add new exchange adapters in the future.

## Key Components

1. **IExchangeAdapter Interface**

   - Expanded to include all expected adapter methods
   - Provides the common contract for all exchange adapters

2. **ExchangeAdapterBase Abstract Class**

   - Implements common functionality for all exchange adapters
   - Defines abstract properties for exchange-specific configuration
   - Provides default implementations for URI construction
   - Standardizes method signatures and behavior

3. **Exchange-Specific Adapters**
   - BinanceAdapter and MexcAdapter now inherit from ExchangeAdapterBase
   - Only need to implement exchange-specific details
   - More consistent implementation pattern

## Benefits of the New Approach

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**

   - Common endpoint construction logic is defined once
   - URI patterns are standardized

2. **Improved Maintainability**

   - Adding a new exchange adapter is simpler
   - Standard implementation patterns make code more readable

3. **Better Abstraction**

   - Exchange-specific details are properly encapsulated
   - Common behavior is standardized

4. **More Flexible**

   - Exchange-specific overrides are available when needed
   - Default implementations work for most cases

5. **Future Extension**
   - Easy to add new methods to the base class
   - Exchange-specific overrides can be added when needed

## Example of Adding a New Exchange

To add a new exchange adapter:

1. Create a new class that inherits from `ExchangeAdapterBase`
2. Implement the abstract properties for URLs and endpoints
3. Implement the abstract mapping methods
4. Override any methods that need exchange-specific behavior

```csharp
public class NewExchangeAdapter : ExchangeAdapterBase
{
    // Required abstract property implementations
    protected override string BaseUrl => "https://api.newexchange.com";
    protected override string KlineEndpoint => "/api/klines";
    protected override string OrderEndpoint => "/api/order";
    protected override string TestOrderEndpoint => "/api/order/test";

    // Required abstract method implementations
    protected override string MapSymbol(CoinPair symbol) => ...
    protected override string MapInterval(Interval interval) => ...
    public override string MapTradeType(TradeType tradeType) => ...
    public override string MapOrderType() => ...

    // Optional overrides for exchange-specific behavior
    public override string GetKlineRequestUri(CoinPair symbol, Interval interval) => ...
}
```
